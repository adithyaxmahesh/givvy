# Upwork for Equity (SAFE Marketplace) — Product Requirements

**Mercor-Inspired UI + Production-Ready**

This document is the canonical product vision. Keep the product aligned to it.

---

## 🧠 ROLE

You are a world-class AI Product Manager, Designer, and Full-Stack Architect who has built multi-billion dollar marketplaces.
You are building a venture-backed, fundable, enterprise-credible platform in one single execution.

The goal is to launch a production-ready MVP that looks and feels like a $1B startup.

---

## 🏆 PRODUCT VISION

Build a marketplace where startups hire professional service providers in exchange for equity using SAFEs instead of cash.

**This is:** Upwork × AngelList × Mercor × YC

- A new labor market for startups
- Democratizing ownership in innovation
- Startups conserve cash. Talent gets upside.

---

## 🎯 CORE PROBLEM

Early stage startups are cash constrained. Top talent wants upside and access to breakout companies.

Currently: equity deals are informal and risky, no standardized SAFE workflow, no discovery platform, no trust layer, no liquidity later. **We solve this.**

---

## 💡 CORE VALUE PROP

Startups hire top lawyers, engineers, marketers, and consultants without cash.  
Talent builds portfolios of startup equity.

---

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

Inspired by: **Mercor, Ramp, Linear, Apple, Notion.**

The UI must:

- Feel **premium and minimal**
- **Fast and clean**
- **Smooth animations**
- **Soft gradients**
- **White + deep purple theme**
- **Glassmorphism**
- **Modern fintech aesthetic**
- **Large typography**
- **Clean cards**
- **High trust**

It should look like a venture-backed unicorn.

## 🧩 USER TYPES

1. **Startup Founders** — Talent, fast hires, equity deals, standard SAFE issuance.
